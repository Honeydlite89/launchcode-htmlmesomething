                     <p>I started with babysitting when I was only 12 years old. I did this to get experience and to start earning money on my own. I watched my neighbors dogs/kids/etc. Met a puppy named Molly! She was my favorite!</p>

                     <p>Started working at Worlds of Fun when I was old enough to apply(15). They assigned me to work in The Pretzel Hut. When i worked there I met a lot of nice people. After a while, they put me in the Dip n' Dots stand where I started making tips. Then eventually I was working in Cotton Candy. Which working in cotton candy was one of the messiest jobs I ever had! I would get off work and come home covered in sugar! It was in my eye lashes, my nose, my hair. Just everywhere! But Worlds of Fun was only a summer job. </p>

                     <p>When the summer was over I decided I wanted to move on to something different and get more experience. So I applied at Steak n' Shake when i was 16years old. They ended up calling me the very next day to set up an interview! I was so excited because it was my first real job and my big brother worked up there too! They trained me on many different positions as well. I worked at the drive-thru, on the line, made shakes, washed dishes, and buss tables for the waitresses. I only worked there for a year before I decided to move on.</p>
                     <p>On my 18th birthday I was hired on to be a Pharmacy Technician at CVS Pharmacy! I was honored! I thought this would be a great career and I would always have a chance to advance in the field. Learning new things was something I really enjoyed doing. Working a cash register was my first position. When I got my finally got my license they started training me on the different positions in the pharmacy. </p>
                     <ul class="pretty-background">
                         <li>Pick up- You look up the patients name and find the patients prescriptions. Ask them if they have any questions for the pharmacist and tell them to have a great day.</li>
                         <li>Production-This is where you print the labels, find the drugs on the shelf, make sure you can read the label, and count the medication to put it in the bottles.</li>
                         <li>Drop off-Patients(customers) drop prescriptions off at the drop off window. You then check to see if the patient has been to our pharmacy before, if they have:make sure their birthday is on the prescription hardcopy, make sure we have a valid phone number to reach them for any issues, and see if they want to wait on it or come back. If they haven't been there before you have to add the patient into the system. Get their allergy list, address, insurance, etc. Then see if they would like to wait or come back. You then proceed to type the prescription into the system. Make sure you have all the valid information about the drug,Dr., and pt. and scan the hardcopy into the system. Then file it.</li>
                         <li>Drive-thru-This position is very similar to pick up. Patients just have the opportunity to drop prescriptions off as well.</li>

                     </ul>
                     <p> After I was trained on all of these positions I began to stand out from the rest. So my boss gave me the title of Inventory Specialist. As an Inventory Specialist I had many duties.</p>
                     <ul class="pretty-background">
                          <li>Ordering Supplies</li>
                          <li>Restocking shelves</li>
                          <li>Making sure all shelf labels are up to date</li>
                          <li>Returnes</li>
                          <ol>
                              <li>Outside Vending returns</li>
                              <li>Warehouse returns</li>
                              <li>Store to Store redeploys</li>
                              <li>Strongpak returns(loose tabs,caps,damaged,etc)</li>
                              <li>Genco returns(outdated items, recalls,etc)</li>
                          </ol>
                          <li>Transfers</li>
                          <li>Credits and Tracking(making sure we got our money back)</li>
                          <li>Cycle counts(making sure our tils are up to date)</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>After another year I recieved the promotion to Lead technician. In this roll I was able to start training newly hired people. As well as Leading my own team to victory! </p>
                     <p>As of now I am 27 years old. I have been a Pharmacy technician for 10 years this December. Also, I just recieved the promotion to District Technician. This is a newly found roll for me so I haven't really expirienced what it is all about just yet. But, I am almost 30 years old and I would like to persue a different career pathway. Starting lauchcode is a new opportunity for me to learn and grow as a person. It has started off difficult for me but creating my own website has been extremely fun! and all I wish to do is excell and use what I've learned here to continue on a new path towards something new and exciting for my future. Thank you for this oppertunity Launchcode!</p>
